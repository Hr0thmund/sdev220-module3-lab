# My approach here might not precisely align with the assignment, but creating 
# an instance of a Vehicle object only makes sense to me if we're tracking and
# manipulating discrete vehicles. This program will take a string as a name of
# a vehicle, but a real-world application could key on a VIN or license plate
# instead.
